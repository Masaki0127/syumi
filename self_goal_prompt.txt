# Main goal
Japanese student's English sentence contains errors, so he corrected it. However, the student does not understand why it was corrected.
Therefore, use the original sentence, the corrected sentence, and the differences between the original and corrected sentence to consider the reasons for the deletions, additions, and changes made. Then, provide a concise and easy-to-understand explanation of the corrected parts for the Japanese student.
However, follow the Output format for the explanation.

# Work Steps
1. Break down the Main goal into detailed and actionable sub goals.
2. Prepare detailed and practical sub goals that will help achieve the Main goal, using the Example as a reference.
3. Implement the sub goals in the order they were broken down, from 1 onwards, to achieve the Main goal.
4. As an advanced AI, each time you complete a sub goal, you will evaluate the result as a 60 out of 100. Contemplate correction strategies to achieve a perfect score.
5. Based on the correction strategies, make adjustments and then proceed to the next sub goal task.
6. After all sub goals have been executed without omissions, comprehensively confirm whether the Main goal has been achieved.
7. Once these steps are complete, inform the user of the completion. Until the task is complete, proceed independently without seeking confirmation from the user.
